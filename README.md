Abilities:
Ability to quickly prototype idea and fix potential program issues by using live immersive environment.

Goals:
Learn about concepts of pure object oriented (message oriented) and fully reflective dynamic languages.
Introduce a history of Smallltalk and impact to SW industry: terms like IDE, unit tests and TDD (test driven development), XP, anonymous functions (lamdas ~ lexical closures).
Learn about ability to modify a program on fly during runtime. 
Introduce pure object oriented system Pharo - a modern implementation of reflective and pure OO language based on Smalltalk80. 
Learn why image based approach is again popular (ie. Docker technology), what is benefit of shared object memory: joining source code and program runtime.

Learn about debugger-driven development and immediate program feedback.
Introduce meta-programming in Pharo using metalinks and modify a program by changing AST.
Learn about examples in SW industry and research (Visualization, IoT, usage in Aerospace, web stack). 
Learn how Pharo can be integrated with other systems (written in other programming languages) and how to integrate with VCS (i.e. Github) and CI/CD setup including test coverage.
